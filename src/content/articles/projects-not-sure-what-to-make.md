Personal projects are a great way to play with new technologies, learn practical skills, and turn your ideas into reality.

However, sometimes it's just really hard to come up with that initial idea.

Whether you're trying to build something to learn or build something of value that fixes a problem, getting started and consistently working on your project can be challenging.

What's going to keep you working on your project is having an idea you really love, so here's some tips and ideas for coming up with what you want to build next.

## Build For Yourself

Is there something you could code that could make your life easier?

Maybe there's something you could automate in your day-to-day life? Maybe it's a to-do list app tailored to your workflow, a budgeting tool for managing finances, or a personal blog site to share your thoughts.

Here are some fun examples of projects I've built for myself:

### 1. Porfolio Website

My default suggestion for students or young professionals is to consider building a personal / portfolio website with a list of projects or accomplishments.

Here is my past [student portfolio](https://web.archive.org/web/20240101005200/https://matthewmacraebovell.com/):

### 2. Discord "Reminders" Bot

This small Discord bot pings me when I have an upcoming task due on my club's GitHub project board.

Checkout the repository [here](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/github-projects-discord-reminders).

### 3. Custom Work Management App

This is my take on the "make a todo list" project.

### 3. Team Scrum Poker App

The tool my team at work used for Scrum poker shut down so I decided to make my own!

## Build For Someone Else

Consider building something for a friend, family member, or a community you're part of.

This could be a custom website for a small business, a birthday reminder app for a forgetful friend, or a community bulletin board for local events.

Working on a project for someone else adds an extra layer of responsibility and can drive you to polish your work even more.

Here are some examples of projects I've built for others:

### 1. Middle School Math Trainer

My Dad is a middle school teacher and asked me to make him a [tool](https://mathtrainer.mrbovell.ca/exercises/custom/?exercises=divide-from-1-10,squares-up-to-16,percentages-of-whole-numbers-below-100,add-up-to-ten,subtract-up-to-ten,add-up-to-100,subtract-up-to-100,multiply-from-1-10,multiply-by-11-12,divide-by-11-12,roots-up-to-16,common-fractions-to-percentages,percentages-of-whole-numbers-over-100) for his students to practice grade 7 and 8 math problems.

### 2. "Merged": Student Club Events App

Merged was a mobile app and website that aggregated together all of the tech events being organized at Carleton University.

### 3. Computer Science Questions Repository

The [Computer Science Questions Repository](https://questions.carletoncomputerscience.ca/evaluations) is a website that allows students to interactively take past multiple choice tests from the COMP 2804 course at Carleton University.

## Just Add A "Twist"

Is there an app or tool that you use on a daily basis? Maybe you wish that app had a feature that it's currently missing.

This can be a great starting point for a project.

For example, you might take a simple note-taking app and add voice-to-text functionality, or build a photo-sharing app with added privacy features. Think about how you can improve or extend the functionality of existing tools.

## Use New Technology

Is there a new programming language, framework, or tool you've been curious about? Use a personal project as a playground to explore and experiment.

Not every project idea needs to be original. If you're struggling to pick a unique idea, consider remaking an existing project or taking a common idea like a todo list, weather app, etc but it using new technologies you want to learn.

If you're not sure what technology you'd like to try, I'd recommend [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) for suggestions.

## "Build Your Own X"

Check out this repository called ["Build Your Own X"](https://github.com/kjj6198/build-your-own-x).

It includes guides on how to build a whole bunch of interesting stuff from scratch, such as:

- Your own operating system
- Your own search engine
- Your own programming language
- and much much more!

Exploring these projects can be an excellent way to dive deep into the fundamentals of technology and gain a comprehensive understanding of how things work under the hood.

## Conclusion

Remember, the key to coming up with a great project idea is to look at your interests, your daily life, and the needs of those around you. Whether you're building something for yourself, for someone else, or just for the fun of learning something new, the possibilities are endless. Happy building!
