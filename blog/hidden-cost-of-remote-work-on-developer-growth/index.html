While I haven’t felt stunted in growing my technical experience, it feels like there are fewer opportunities to develop the non-technical skills that are critical for long-term career progression—skills like understanding broader business goals, and adapting to different audiences.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, I had the chance to meet my fully remote team in person for the first time during a company onsite. The primary goal of this meetup was to accelerate the early planning stages of our next project.</p>
<p>As you’d expect from the onsite, I was tasked with sharing ideas and providing real-time feedback. However, I noticed something unexpected—my contributions didn’t resonate the way they typically do when I’m speaking with other developers.</p>
<p>At first, I was confused. While I wouldn’t claim to be a top-tier speaker, I’ve always felt confident in my ability to tailor my message for different demographics of people, particularly during presentations and situations I have ample time to prepare and consider what examples will best resonate with the expected crowd.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I realized that my day-to-day work rarely demands adapting my communication on the fly—a stark contrast to scenarios where I have the time to prepare.</p>
<p>Most of my interactions are with fellow developers, where the focus is on technical details (something I’m definitely better at) rather than conveying customer or business-facing value. When I do need to address broader audiences—such as during demos or stakeholder presentations—it’s typically after having had the opportunity to prepare thoroughly.</p>
<p>To some extent, this is an expected outcome of remote work, where the casual, spontaneous conversations you’d have in an office setting with members of other departments are largely absent. However, I think there are some aspects of specifically “developer remote work culture” that have made it even more challenging for individuals at my career stage to practice these skills.</p>
<p>Since starting my first “real job” in 2019, I’ve worked remotely for eight different development organizations and one thing that has been consistent across the board is that <strong>developers tend to be very meeting adverse.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly, I get it. I’ve also rolled my eyes at unnecessary rituals with over-the-top names like “pre-pre refinements” or “retrospective retrospectives.” I’ve sat through countless corporate presentations and town halls, knowing full well that many of the topics—like quarterly earnings or company mission statements—would never directly impact my day-to-day work.</p>
<p>However, looking back, I realize now that aside from maybe my engineering manager or tech lead, most of the engineering teams I’ve been part of were rarely included in product discussions or customer-oriented conversations.</p>
<p>Across all my remote work experience, it feels to me like very few of the organizations have systematically prioritized making an effort to consistently include developers in this vein.</p>
<p>While there are valid reasons for this—such as the need to protect developer time (and by extension, reduce costs)—<em>I can’t help but wonder if it’s also influenced by the developer culture of generally being resistant towards meetings.</em></p>
<p>Most of my days are spent sitting at my desk, coding in isolation, with standup often being the only interaction I have with coworkers. While I initially appreciated the efficiency this setup offered, I’ve started to question its long-term impact. I now see how this lack of engagement could hinder the development of essential skills and, ultimately, affect the progression of my career.</p>
<p>This realization doesn’t change the fact that I still enjoy remote work and the flexibility it brings to my life. But it does mean that I need to be more intentional about seeking out opportunities to develop these skills. If I were in an office setting, these moments might occur more naturally, however for someone in my situation, advocating to join customer interviews, product discussions, or stakeholder presentations is essential.</p>
<p>Ultimately, technical expertise will only take you so far. To grow as a developer and a professional, it’s important to step outside the comfort zone of purely technical discussions and engage in conversations that align with broader business goals. Remote work might make this more challenging for those early in their career, but with intentional effort, it’s possible to bridge the gap and ensure you’re building the skills that matter for the long run.</p>  <div> <div></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="Footer"> <p>© 2024 Matthew MacRae Bovell</p> </footer>  </body>
